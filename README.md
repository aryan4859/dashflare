[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/jorgelbg/dashflare)

# dashflare

Dashflare is a privacy first analytics solution for monitoring your websites. It can be self hosted
on a practically any hosting solution and it should scale with your needs. Data collection is handled
by a [Cloudflare Edge](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) Worker running the code included in this repository.

Two additional components are required for having the full suite running:

- Grafana (handles the data visualization)
- Grafana Loki (handles the data persistence)

The default provided dashboard looks like:

## üå• Cloudflare

One requirement to use the current solution is to be already using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for the
website that you want to monitor.

## üéÆ Installation / Getting started

A minimal production-like environment is provided and can be used through
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```
‚ùØ docker-compose up
```

### üîë Grafana authentication

Grafana will be accessible in `http://localhost:3000/` and the default user and password are:

- user: admin
- password: admin

> **You will be asked to change it after the first successful login.**

Cloudflare Edge Workers have certain limitations that prohibit any connection between the edge worker
and any outside resource that cannot be reached through the ports `80` or `443`. By default Loki is
listening on port `3100`, you can either change this or run Loki behind a transparent proxy. Grafana is listening in the default port (`3000`).

Another security practice of Cloudflare Edge Workers is that requests from the edge worker can only be made
against endpoints that are associated with a domain. This means that if you try to set the
`LOKI_HOST` environment variable to an IP address, the edge worker will not be able send any data.

> It is still possible to run loki locally, we need to expose the loki instance
> to the Internet directly in a domain/subdomain. Another posibility (especially
> useful for development) is to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
> to forward the traffic.

## ü§† wrangler

In order to deploy the edge worker a workable node/npm environment is needed. After installing
node/npm on your development environment, we need to install
[wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) which is the CLI tool that cloudflare offers to
interact with the edge workers platform.

```sh
‚ùØ npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

`wrangler` CLI tool needs access to your Cloudflare account. This is normally achieved by running:

```sh
‚ùØ wrangler config
```

Or you can directly go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens, and create a new token
using the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template. You can also expose the token via the `CF_API_TOKEN`
environment variable.

There are two values needed for wrangler to work: `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_ZONE_ID`. `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` is
your Cloudflare's Accound ID and you can get it (along with the `CF_ZONE_ID`) from your Cloudflare
dashboard: dash.cloudflare.com.

You can use the `.envrc.example` file as an example of the variables that should be set. We recommend
copying the `.envrc.example` file into `.envrc` and loading the configuration into your shell
environment after editing the file:

```sh
‚ùØ cp .envrc.example .envrc
# edit `.envrc` to adjust the values
‚ùØ source .envrc
```

### Environment variables

This is a list of the environment variables that are needed for the Dashflare edge worker to generate
the events:

We extract the country name from your visitor's requests. We also provide additional geolocation capabilities via the
integration with the [ipgeolocationapi.com] API.

- `IPINFO`: (optional) [ipgeolocationapi.com] is used to capture additionl geolocation data from your visitors. It is still possible to opt out of this feature by setting this variable to `false`.
- `CLIENT_ID`: If you're self hosting Dashflare, `CLIENT_ID` can be omitted, or set to any value.
  By default it is set to `fake` in [`.envrc.example`](./.envrc.example).
- `LOKI_HOST`: URL where the Loki instance is accessible, it cannot be an IP address (`1.2.3.4`) nor a domain
  containing a custom port (`loki.example.com:31001`). A subdomain will work just fine (i.e loki.example.com)
- `FINGERPRINT`: Its used as the key for the session id hash calculation. A random key can be
  generated using:

  ```sh
  ‚ùØ openssl rand -base64 32  | md5
  ```

- `DOMAIN`: URL of your "primary domain". The edge worker will be deployed into a custom subdomain
  (within `.workers.dev` if you're using the free tier). This variable is used to generate
  automatic [routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/routes/). This can be configured
  through the Cloudflare's Dashboard as well.

## üó∫ Routes

When the edge worker is deployed it will be running in a custom domain (`.workers.dev` if you're
using the free tier). We need to "forward" the requests from the main domain to the edge worker
domain. Cloudflare handles this via routes
[routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/routes/). When using the `make wrangler`
command a default set of routes will be generated using the `DOMAIN` environment variable.

Since the forwarding will be done by Cloudflare there is no change required to the website on your
original domain. Not even a new `script` tag is needed.

## üî• Publishing the edge worker

After `wrangler` is installed, and the environment variables are set, we can deploy our edge worker.
Before we need to generate a valid `wrangler.toml` file. A handy make target is provided to do this:

```sh
‚ùØ make wrangler
```

> The `make wrangler` command depends on [envsubst](https://linux.die.net/man/1/envsubst).

This command will take the [wrangler.toml.template](./wrangler.toml.template) file as a template a
generate a valid wrangler configuration file (`wrangler.toml`).

> You can inspect/edit the `wrangler.toml` file. Especially the `routes` section might be of interest
> to you.

Finally we can publish/deploy our edge worker:

```sh
‚ùØ wrangler publish
```

This command will build and publish the worker to Cloudflare's edge network.
